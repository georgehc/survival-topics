The Apache license below applies to the two code files in this directory:
`scholar.py` and `sparse_scholar.py`. All other code files in this
repository are under an MIT license given in `../LICENSE` (the LICENSE file in
the root directory of the repository).

Note that the two files `scholar.py` and `sparse_scholar.py` are slightly
modified from Dallas Card's code (the modifications are by George H. Chen and
are specifically to add survival supervision, to support an approximation to
LDA as the topic model, and to encourage sparsity in SAGE); the original code
is here:

The license file can be found here (for which our modified versions use the
same license especially as the modifications we have made are rather limited;
the license file is the Apache License 2.0):
